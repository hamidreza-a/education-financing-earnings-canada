## Overview
This paper examines how different sources of educational financing are associated with post-graduation labour-market earnings in Canada. Using microdata from the 2020 National Graduates Survey (NGS), the study estimates log-linear OLS earnings models to assess whether financing mechanisms independently shape early-career outcomes.

Earnings are interpreted as a proxy for individual productivity and economic return to education.

## Research Question
How do different sources of postsecondary education financing affect labour-market earnings among Canadian graduates three years after graduation?

---

## Data
- **Primary dataset:** 2020 National Graduates Survey (NGS), Statistics Canada  
- **Supplementary data:** 2023 Labour Force Survey (LFS) medians used to construct continuous earnings measures  
- **Sample:** Employed graduates with strictly positive annual earnings (N ≈ 12,600)

## Methodology
- Dependent variable: log of annual earnings  
- Estimation method: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)  
- Specifications:
  - Baseline model with financing variables only  
  - Full model with demographic, educational, regional, and family background controls  
- Robust HC1 standard errors used to address heteroskedasticity

## Key Findings
- Government student loans and government grants are associated with **lower earnings**
- Savings/work income, bank loans, and employer funding are associated with **higher earnings**
- Employer funding shows the strongest positive earnings premium
- Results remain robust after controlling for observable characteristics

## Contribution
This study provides new Canadian evidence on the heterogeneous effects of education financing mechanisms—beyond debt alone—on labour-market earnings. The findings are relevant for education funding policy and human-capital development strategies.
